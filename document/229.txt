Embedded systems are computer systems that are designed to carry out specific functions within a larger system. They are often found in everyday items such as cell phones, appliances, vehicles, and other everyday products. Embedded systems are designed to interact with their environment, and their components are integrated into the larger system. Embedded systems are used to control, monitor, and communicate with other systems.

Embedded systems can be divided into two main categories: hard real-time and soft real-time. Hard real-time systems are designed to respond to events within a specific time frame, while soft real-time systems are designed to respond to events within a general time frame. Examples of hard real-time systems include aircraft control systems and industrial process control systems, while examples of soft real-time systems include medical equipment and home appliances.

The components of embedded systems consist of hardware, software, and firmware. Hardware components include microprocessors, memory, input/output (I/O) devices, and display devices. Software components include operating systems, communications protocols, and application software. Firmware components include bootstrap code, device drivers, and configuration settings.

Embedded systems offer many benefits over traditional computing systems. They are smaller, more power efficient, and can be more reliable than traditional systems. Additionally, embedded systems are more cost-effective as they are designed for specific tasks and require less hardware and software. Finally, embedded systems can be easily integrated into existing systems, making them suitable for applications that require customization.
