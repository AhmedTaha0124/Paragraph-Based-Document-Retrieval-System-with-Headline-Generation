Data engineering is the process of transforming large volumes of raw data into meaningful information that can be used for decision making. It involves a combination of data collection, processing, cleaning, and integration to produce datasets that can be used for predictive analytics and data analysis. The data engineering process helps to identify patterns in data, uncover trends, and develop insights that can be used to inform business decisions. Data engineering is an essential part of the data science pipeline, as it is responsible for the development of datasets and the integration of data sources.

Data integration is the process of combining data from multiple sources into a single set of data. This is done by extracting data from multiple sources, transforming it, and then loading it into a single repository. Data integration is an important step in the data engineering process, as it ensures that data from different sources can be used together to gain valuable insights. Data integration is often done using ETL (Extract Transform Load) tools, which are designed to automate the process of data integration.

Data cleaning is the process of removing or correcting invalid or incomplete data from a dataset. This is necessary to ensure that the data is accurate and consistent. Data cleaning involves identifying and correcting invalid data points, normalizing data, and dealing with missing values. Data cleaning is an important step in the data engineering process, as it ensures that the data is accurate and consistent.

Data visualization is the process of visualizing data in order to gain insights and make better decisions. Data visualization is an important part of the data engineering process, as it helps to identify patterns and trends in data that can be used to inform decision making. Data visualization is often done using tools such as charts, graphs, and maps to make data more meaningful and easier to understand.
