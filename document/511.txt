Software testing is a process of evaluating the functional and non-functional requirements of a system or application with the intent of finding errors and bugs before the system is released to the end user. It is an integral part of software development, as it helps to ensure that the software meets the user’s expectations and requirements.

Software testing can be divided into two main types – functional testing and non-functional testing. Functional testing verifies the functionality of the software, while non-functional testing evaluates the performance, security, reliability, and other aspects of the software.

Software testing helps to improve the quality of the software by identifying and fixing errors before the software is released to the end user. It also helps to reduce the cost of software development, as errors are identified early in the development process and can be fixed easily. In addition, software testing helps to ensure that the software meets the user’s requirements and expectations.

The best practices for software testing include writing clear and comprehensive test cases, using automated tools and frameworks, conducting periodic tests, and regularly reviewing results. It is also important to ensure that all tests are run on a regular basis and to document the results of each test. By following these best practices, software developers can ensure that their software meets the user’s requirements and expectations.
