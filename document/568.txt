Chatbots are computer programs designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the Internet. They can be used in customer service, marketing, and other areas where automated conversations can improve efficiency or provide a better experience for the user. Chatbots are typically powered by artificial intelligence (AI), which allows them to understand and respond to the user's input.

Language and natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science and linguistics that focuses on the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. NLP enables computers to understand and interpret the meaning of human language, allowing for natural conversation between computers and humans. NLP technologies are used to build chatbots, voice assistants, and other intelligent systems.

Language modeling is the task of predicting the next word in a sequence of words. It is a key component of many natural language processing (NLP) systems, such as chatbots and voice assistants. Language models are trained using large datasets of text, and they learn to assign probabilities to each word in a sentence or phrase, allowing them to predict the most likely next word.

Chatbots leverage language modeling to understand and respond to user input. By training a language model on large datasets of text, a chatbot can learn to understand the meaning of user input and generate an appropriate response. Language models are used to generate natural-sounding responses that make conversations more engaging and provide a better user experience.
