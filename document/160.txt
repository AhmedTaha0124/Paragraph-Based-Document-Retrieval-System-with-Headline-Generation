Cyber security is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money from users, or interrupting normal business processes. Cyber security is important for protecting businesses, organizations, and individuals from malicious digital attacks.

Cyber security attacks come in many forms and can target businesses, individuals, and government organizations. Common types of cyber attacks include phishing, malware, ransomware, and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Each type of attack has a different goal and requires different countermeasures to protect against them.

Organizations and individuals can implement a wide range of cyber security measures to protect against malicious attacks. These measures include implementing strong passwords and two-factor authentication, regularly patching software and operating systems, and using antivirus and anti-malware software. Organizations should also consider using network monitoring tools to detect suspicious activity and detect network intrusions.

Cyber security professionals play a crucial role in protecting organizations from cyber attacks. These professionals are responsible for designing, maintaining, and monitoring network security systems, developing security policies, and responding to cyber security incidents. Cyber security professionals must have a strong understanding of cyber security principles, the latest security technologies, and ethical hacking techniques.
