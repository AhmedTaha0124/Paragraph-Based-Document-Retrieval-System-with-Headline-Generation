Network access control (NAC) is an important security concept designed to protect networks from unauthorized access. It is a technology-based system that verifies the identity and credentials of all devices trying to access the network. NAC typically uses a combination of authentication, authorization, and encryption to ensure that legitimate devices and users are granted access to the network, while malicious actors are blocked.

Firewalls are an essential part of a secure network setup. They act as a barrier between the internal network and the external world, preventing unauthorized access to the network. Firewalls are typically deployed in a layered approach, with each layer providing an additional layer of security. Common types of firewalls include packet-filtering firewalls, application-level firewalls, and virtual private networks.

Network segmentation is an important security concept that divides the network into smaller, logically separated segments or zones. This helps to limit the spread of malicious content and limit the attack surface by restricting access to certain parts of the network. It is also useful for isolating sensitive data and systems such as servers and databases, ensuring that only authorized users can access them.

Wireless networks are becoming increasingly popular, but they also present additional security risks. It is important to secure wireless networks to prevent unauthorized access. This can be done by using encryption, setting up authentication methods, and disabling unused services. Additionally, it is important to use strong passwords and regularly update firmware to ensure the security of the wireless network.
