Cyber security is a discipline that focuses on protecting networks, computers, programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access. It is a field of study that incorporates a range of topics from network security to cryptography and application security. Cyber security is an important part of any business’s operations and understanding the basics of the discipline can help organizations protect their systems from malicious actors.

Part of cyber security is identifying the security risks and vulnerabilities that exist in a system or network. This requires a comprehensive understanding of how systems and networks work and the types of threats that can be posed. Security professionals must also have an understanding of the different types of malicious actors and the techniques they may use to exploit system weaknesses. 

Once security risks and vulnerabilities have been identified, cyber security professionals must develop and implement controls to protect the systems and networks. This includes the implementation of access controls, identification and authentication systems, encryption protocols, and firewalls. It also includes the development of security policies and procedures such as patch management and vulnerability scanning. 

In addition to developing and implementing security controls, cyber security professionals must also be able to monitor for threats and respond appropriately if an attack is detected. This requires an understanding of the tools and techniques used to detect malicious activity and the ability to respond quickly and effectively. Cyber security professionals must also have the ability to identify and respond to emerging threats in order to protect an organization’s systems and data.
