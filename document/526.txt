Software testing is the process of evaluating a software system or application to determine if it meets specified requirements and to identify any areas in which the software does not perform correctly. It involves executing a program or application with the intent of finding errors and verifying that the software product meets specified requirements. Software testing helps to ensure that the software is of high quality, reliable, and secure.

Software testing can be divided into two broad categories: functional testing and non-functional testing. Functional testing is the process of ensuring that all the features of a system are working correctly. Non-functional testing is the process of ensuring that the system meets the performance, usability, and other non-functional requirements. Examples of non-functional tests include security testing, load testing, and performance testing.

Software testing helps to uncover bugs and errors in the software product, ensuring that it is of high quality and reliable. It also helps to identify any potential security issues and helps to improve system performance. Additionally, software testing helps to reduce the risk of costly errors and ensure that the software meets the customer’s needs.
