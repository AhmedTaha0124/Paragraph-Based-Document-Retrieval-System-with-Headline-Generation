Encryption is a powerful tool for ensuring the safety of data traversing a network. By scrambling data packets and making them unreadable to all but the intended recipient, encryption prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive information. This is especially useful in an age where cyber attacks are becoming increasingly common and sophisticated. Encryption is also an important part of compliance with data privacy regulations such as HIPAA, GDPR, and CCPA.

Network segmentation is a security measure used to isolate different parts of a network from one another. By creating distinct subnets and deploying firewalls and other security measures between them, it is possible to prevent malicious actors from moving laterally across a network. This helps to protect internal systems from external threats and can also reduce the scope of a breach in the event one does occur.

Network access control (NAC) is a system of software, hardware, and policies used to regulate the usage of a network. By requiring users to authenticate themselves and granting access only to those whose credentials have been verified, NAC can help to prevent unauthorized access and reduce the risk of malicious activity. NAC can also be used to restrict the use of certain applications or websites, ensuring that users are not able to access anything that could compromise the security of the network.

Intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are tools used to detect and prevent malicious activity on a network. By monitoring network traffic for suspicious activities, IPS can detect and stop malicious actors before they can cause any real harm. IPS can also be used to flag suspicious behavior and alert administrators, allowing them to take the appropriate action and mitigate any potential damage.
