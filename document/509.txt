Software testing is a process of verifying the behavior of an application under different conditions and validating that it meets the requirements of the system. It helps to identify the defects in the system and ensure that the system is working as expected.

Software testing provides many benefits to businesses, including improved quality, more efficient development cycles, and reduced costs. By testing applications thoroughly, businesses can ensure that their products are of a higher quality and that they can be released on schedule.

Software testing can be divided into several main categories, including functional testing, performance testing, security testing, usability testing, and compatibility testing. Each type of test has its own purpose and is used to evaluate different aspects of the application.

Software testing is important for businesses as it helps to ensure that their applications are of high quality and meet the requirements of their customers. It also helps to reduce the chances of any problems occurring after the application is released.
