Cyber security, also known as information technology security, is the practice of protecting networks, systems, and data from malicious attacks. It is the process of ensuring that digital systems and information are secure and protected from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction. Cyber security is an essential part of any organizationâ€™s cybersecurity strategy. It involves the use of technologies, processes, and procedures to protect networks, computers, programs, and data from malicious attacks.

There are numerous types of cyber security threats, such as malware, ransomware, phishing, and social engineering. Malware is malicious software that can damage or steal data from a computer system. Ransomware is software that holds a computer system hostage until a certain amount of money is paid. Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where an attacker attempts to steal confidential information by sending fraudulent emails or messages. Social engineering is a type of attack that relies on human interaction to gain access to confidential information.

Protecting against cyber security threats requires a comprehensive approach that includes measures such as strong passwords, firewalls, antivirus software, and regular updates. It is also important to be aware of the latest cyber security threats and how to protect against them. Organizations should also have policies and procedures in place to ensure that employees are adequately trained and informed about cyber security.

Cyber security is essential for any organization, as it helps protect sensitive information from malicious attacks. It is important to take the necessary steps to protect networks, systems, and data from unauthorized access, modification, or destruction. By implementing appropriate measures, organizations can reduce the risk of cyber security threats and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their systems and data.
