Firewalls are an essential part of a secure network. They act as a filter between the public Internet and a private network, controlling access and preventing malicious activity. Firewalls can be implemented in both hardware and software form, and are configured using rules that specify which traffic is allowed. Firewalls are also used to detect and prevent malicious traffic, and can be used to monitor network activity for suspicious behavior.

Network segmentation is an important security measure used to protect critical network resources from malicious activity. By separating the network into distinct segments, each segment can be secured separately, reducing the risk of a data breach. Network segmentation also helps to reduce the amount of traffic on the network, improving performance and preventing traffic bottlenecks.

Encryption is a key security measure used to protect data from unauthorized access. Encryption scrambles data so it can only be decoded by authorized users. Encryption is used to protect data stored in the cloud, as well as data transmitted over a network, ensuring that only authorized users can access the data.

Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are used to detect malicious activity on a network. They use a variety of techniques, such as signature-based detection, anomaly-based detection, and behavior-based detection, to identify suspicious activity. IDSs can alert administrators to potential security threats, allowing them to take action and prevent unauthorized access to the network.
