Data warehousing is a collection of technologies and processes used to store and manage large amounts of data. It is typically used to store data from multiple sources, such as enterprise systems, for reporting and analysis. Data warehouses are typically designed to support reporting and analysis of data that is difficult to obtain from operational systems.

Data warehousing provides a number of advantages over traditional storage systems. It can store large amounts of data from multiple sources in a single, secure location. This makes it easier to analyze data from multiple sources and create reports that are consistent across the organization. Data warehouses also reduce the complexity of managing data from multiple sources, since all data is stored in one centralized location.

A data warehouse typically consists of three main components: a data storage layer, an ETL layer, and an analytics layer. The data storage layer stores the data in a format that is optimized for analysis. The ETL layer is responsible for extracting, transforming, and loading the data into the data warehouse. The analytics layer performs the analysis on the data and creates reports and visualizations.

Data warehousing is typically implemented using a star schema architecture. This architecture consists of a central fact table surrounded by multiple dimension tables. The fact table stores the data about the business process being studied, while the dimension tables store the attributes of the data. This architecture makes it easier to query the data and create reports based on the relationships between the fact and dimension tables.
