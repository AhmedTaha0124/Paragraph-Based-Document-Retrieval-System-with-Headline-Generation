Cyber security is the practice of protecting networks, systems, and programs from digital attacks. These attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money from users, or interrupting normal business processes. Cyber security is a combination of technologies, processes, and practices designed to protect networks, devices, programs, and data from attack, damage, or unauthorized access.

Cyber attacks can take many forms, including denial-of-service attacks, ransomware, phishing, and malware. Denial-of-service attacks overwhelm a system with traffic, making it unresponsive to legitimate requests. Ransomware encrypts data and demands payment for its release. Phishing attempts to trick users into revealing sensitive information. Malware is malicious software that can damage or take control of computers.

Organizations can employ several best practices to protect against cyber attacks. These include using firewalls to limit access to networks, implementing strong authentication methods, regularly updating systems, and training employees to recognize and report suspicious activity. Additionally, organizations should have a comprehensive incident response plan to address any potential security incidents.

As technology continues to evolve and organizations become increasingly reliant on digital systems, the importance of cyber security is growing. Organizations must be proactive in protecting their networks and systems from cyber attacks, as a breach can have significant financial and reputational consequences. It is essential for organizations to take the necessary steps to ensure their networks are secure.
