Network security involves protecting the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of network systems and resources. It is an essential part of any organization's IT infrastructure and must be taken seriously. Network security involves both technical measures and administrative procedures that control access to the network and its resources. It also includes the prevention of malicious code and activities such as hacking, phishing, and DDOS attacks.

Network security measures can be implemented on both the hardware and software level. On the hardware level, firewalls and intrusion detection systems are used to protect the network from external and internal threats. On the software level, antivirus and anti-malware programs are used to protect the system from malicious code. Access control measures such as authentication and authorization can also be used to restrict access to the system.

Network security policies are the set of rules and regulations that govern the use of a network. These policies can be used to define who has access to the network, what activities are allowed on the network, and how the network is monitored and managed. Network security policies should be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that they remain effective.

Network security audits are an essential part of any organization's network security strategy. Audits are used to identify security vulnerabilities and recommend measures to address them. Audits can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of existing security measures and identify areas for improvement.
