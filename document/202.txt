Embedded systems are computer systems that are designed to perform specific tasks within a larger system. They are typically composed of a combination of hardware and software components, and are used in a wide range of applications, such as telecommunications, medical instrumentation, industrial automation, automotive, robotics, and consumer electronics. The primary goal of embedded systems is to allow for the integration of hardware and software components into a product or system that can be used to perform specific tasks.

Embedded systems can be categorized according to the type of processor they use. The most common types are microcontrollers, digital signal processors, and system-on-chip devices. Microcontrollers are typically used in simpler applications such as consumer electronics and automotive applications. Digital signal processors are used in more complex applications such as telecommunications, medical instrumentation, and industrial automation. System-on-chip devices are used in applications where performance and power efficiency are paramount.

The programming language of choice for embedded systems is usually C or C++. These languages are widely used due to their portability and low resource requirements. In addition, certain microcontrollers and digital signal processors can be programmed using assembly language, which is still widely used in some applications.

Embedded systems offer several key advantages over traditional computing systems. They are compact, require less power, and can be programmed to perform specific tasks with limited hardware resources. Furthermore, embedded systems are often less expensive than traditional computing systems, and can be used in a wide variety of applications.
