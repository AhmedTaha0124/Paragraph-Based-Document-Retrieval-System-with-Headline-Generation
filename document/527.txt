Software testing is an important process of verifying and validating a software to ensure that it meets the required specifications and performs as expected. It is the process of executing a program or application to identify the bugs or errors and validate that the actual results match the expected results. Software testing can be divided into two main types: functional and non-functional testing. Functional testing is concerned with the correctness of the program, and non-functional testing is concerned with the performance and usability of the program.

Software testing ensures that the application meets the customer's requirements and helps to identify any issues in the code before it is released. It also helps to reduce the cost of development and maintenance by finding errors early in the process. Additionally, software testing can help increase customer satisfaction by ensuring that the application works as expected.

Software testing can be conducted at various levels. Unit testing is a type of testing that tests individual units of code, such as functions and classes. Integration testing is a type of testing that tests how different modules interact with each other. System testing is a type of testing that tests the whole system, including hardware and software components.

Automated software testing is a process of running tests using automated tools. It helps to reduce the time and effort required to conduct tests, as well as reduce the chances of human errors. Automated testing can also be used to run tests in multiple environments and generate reports. Automation testing is mainly used for regression testing and functional testing.
