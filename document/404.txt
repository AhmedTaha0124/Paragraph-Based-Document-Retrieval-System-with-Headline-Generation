Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The process of learning begins with the observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

Machine learning can be broadly classified into three categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning involves training a machine using labeled data, which has been labeled by humans. Unsupervised learning involves the machine to learn from unlabeled data and draw conclusions from it. Finally, reinforcement learning involves the machine interacting with its environment and learning from its mistakes.

Machine learning has become increasingly popular and is used in a wide range of applications. Common applications include image recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and predictive analytics. Machine learning is also used in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and other forms of automation.

Machine learning has the potential to improve accuracy and efficiency in many areas. By automating processes, it can reduce the need for manual interventions and the possibility of human error. It can also help create models that can provide more accurate predictions than traditional methods. Additionally, it can improve decision-making by providing real-time insights into data and allowing for faster decision-making.
