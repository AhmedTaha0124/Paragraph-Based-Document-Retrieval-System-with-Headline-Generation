Problem solving and data structures are two fundamental concepts in computer science. Problem solving involves developing algorithms and data structures are used to represent and organize data. In computer programming, data structures are used to organize data and problem solving is used to find solutions to complex tasks. By understanding problem solving and data structures, programmers can develop efficient and effective programs. 

The first step in problem solving is to understand the problem. This involves analyzing the problem and breaking it down into smaller parts. By understanding the problem, it is possible to identify the data structures that are necessary to solve the problem. It is also important to identify the inputs and outputs of the problem so that the data structures can be used in the most efficient manner. 

Once the problem is understood, the next step is to analyze the data structures. Data structures are used to represent data in a specific way. Different data structures have different characteristics and can be used to represent and organize data in different ways. By understanding the characteristics of different data structures, it is possible to select the appropriate data structure for the problem at hand. 

The final step in problem solving is to apply problem solving strategies. Different strategies can be used to solve problems, such as using algorithms, searching, sorting, and other methods. By understanding the problem, analyzing data structures, and applying appropriate problem solving strategies, it is possible to develop efficient and effective solutions to complex problems.
