Data engineering is the process of designing, building, and maintaining data processing systems. It combines aspects of traditional engineering, including software engineering, database engineering, and analytics engineering. Data engineers are responsible for gathering, storing, and organizing large amounts of data in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Data engineering also involves developing tools and processes to analyze and visualize data so that it can be used to make informed decisions.

Data engineering pipelines are the workflows and processes created to transform data from one format to another. Pipelines are used to move data from source to destination, as well as to process and analyze it. Common data engineering pipelines include data ingestion, data transformation, data cleaning, data storage, and data analysis. Data engineering pipelines are essential for creating a reliable and efficient data infrastructure.

Data modeling is the process of designing data structures that can be used to store and analyze data. It involves creating a model that captures the relationships between different entities in a data set. Data modeling enables data engineers to better understand the data and create efficient queries. Additionally, data modeling helps data engineers optimize data storage and reduce duplication.

Data visualization is the process of transforming data into visual representations such as graphs and charts. Data visualization is used to help users gain deeper insights into the data and better understand the patterns and trends in the data. Data visualization also helps data engineers communicate the results of their analyses to stakeholders.
