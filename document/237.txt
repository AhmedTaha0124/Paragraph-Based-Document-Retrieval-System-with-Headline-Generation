Embedded systems are computer systems that are integrated into larger systems for the purpose of performing specific tasks. These systems are often designed to perform a specific task in a limited and enclosed environment such as an automobile, an appliance or any other device. Embedded systems can range from simple microcontrollers to sophisticated systems that include multiple processors.

Embedded systems offer numerous advantages, such as increased performance, accuracy, reliability, reduced size and cost. They can be used in a wide range of applications such as consumer electronics, automotive, medical and industrial. Embedded systems are also often used in safety-critical applications, as they offer better control and reliability than general-purpose computers.

An embedded system consists of components such as a processor, memory, input/output devices, and storage. The processor is the main component of an embedded system and is responsible for executing instructions from a program. Memory is used to store the program and data. Input/output devices such as sensors, switches, and displays are used to interact with the user and the environment. Storage is used to store large amounts of data and program files.

Embedded systems are often required to perform complex tasks in a limited environment. This presents several challenges such as power consumption, reliability and security. Power consumption is an important factor as embedded systems often have limited power sources. Reliability is an important factor as embedded systems are often used in safety-critical applications. Security is another challenge as embedded systems are vulnerable to malicious attacks.
