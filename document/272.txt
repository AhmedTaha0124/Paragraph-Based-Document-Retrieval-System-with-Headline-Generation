Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic. OOP is based on the concept of objects, which contain data and instructions for manipulating the data. OOP languages offer a number of benefits compared to other programming paradigms, such as improved code organization, ease of debugging, and increased code reuse. This makes OOP an ideal choice for developers who want to quickly create complex applications.

Object-oriented thinking is a core principle behind object-oriented programming. When writing code, developers should break down their application into objects that represent real-world entities. This allows them to create a better understanding of the problem and enables them to design a solution that is both efficient and easy to maintain. By using OOP, developers are able to create applications that are much more maintainable and extensible.

Classes are the building blocks of OOP. A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It contains the data (known as fields) and the instructions (known as methods) for manipulating the data. When a class is instantiated, an object is created which contains the data and methods from the class. This object can then be used to interact with the rest of the application.

Interfaces are an important part of OOP because they provide a way to structure and organize the objects in an application. An interface is an abstract description of an object that defines the methods that the object must implement. By using an interface, developers can ensure that all objects that implement the interface have the same methods and behavior. This makes it easy to create extensible applications that can easily be adapted to new requirements.
