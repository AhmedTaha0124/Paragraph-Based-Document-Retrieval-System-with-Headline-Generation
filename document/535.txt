Software testing is the process of verifying that a software application or system meets its requirements and performs its intended tasks correctly. Testing can be done manually or by using automated tools and techniques to ensure a product is of high quality and meets the standards set out by the development team. It is an important step in the software development life cycle (SDLC) and can be used to ensure that the software meets the needs of its users.

Software testing can be divided into two categories: functional testing and nonfunctional testing. Functional testing checks the behavior of the software against its requirements to ensure it meets the user's needs. Nonfunctional testing looks at the performance, scalability, and security of the software to make sure it is robust and secure.

Software testing can help identify issues with a product before it is released into the market. This can save time and money by ensuring that any problems are caught early on in the development process. Testing also ensures the quality of the product is high, making it more likely to be successful in the market.

Testing can be a time-consuming process, and it is important to ensure that enough time is allocated for it. Automated tests can help, but they can also be costly and require a skilled tester to set up and maintain. Additionally, testing can be hindered by changes to the application after a test has been completed, making it difficult to find any issues.
