Cyber security is the practice of protecting networks, systems, programs and devices from digital attacks. These attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money from users or interrupting normal business processes. To protect your digital life, it is important to understand the basics of cyber security. This includes the use of strong passwords, firewalls, antivirus software and two-factor authentication. Additionally, you should take precautions to protect your privacy online, such as using a virtual private network (VPN) and avoiding suspicious links and websites.

Network security is a critical component of cyber security. It involves protecting networks from unauthorized access, malware and other threats. Network security is used to protect data stored on the network, as well as all data and communications that pass through the network. It is important to update your network security regularly to ensure that your system is always protected from the latest cyber threats.

Social engineering is a type of cyber attack that relies on human interaction to gain access to confidential information or systems. It is often used to trick victims into revealing passwords, credit card numbers or other sensitive information. To mitigate the risks of social engineering, it is important to be aware of the signs of a potential scam, such as requests for money or personal information, and to never provide personal information to someone you do not know or trust. 

Maintaining strong cyber security requires a multi-layered approach. This includes developing and implementing policies and procedures that are tailored to your organization's needs, using secure software and hardware solutions, and educating users on best practices for cyber security. Additionally, it is important to regularly monitor your systems and networks for potential threats, and to respond quickly to any incidents.
