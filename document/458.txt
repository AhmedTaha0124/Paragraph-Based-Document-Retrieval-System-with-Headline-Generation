Network security is a collection of methods used to protect the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of a computer network and its connected devices. It involves the implementation of various security controls, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption technologies, to protect the network from unauthorized access and malicious attacks.

Network attacks are malicious attempts to disrupt, deny, or gain unauthorized access to a computer network or its connected devices. Common types of network attacks include denial of service (DoS) attacks, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, malicious code injection, and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

Organizations must take proactive steps to protect their networks against potential threats. This includes implementing proper authentication and authorization protocols, securing network components, and using encryption technologies to protect sensitive data. It is also important to regularly monitor the network for suspicious activity and respond quickly to any threats that are detected.

Security best practices are essential for protecting any computer network. This includes having a solid security policy, implementing secure access control measures, regularly patching network devices, and using antivirus and anti-malware solutions. It is also important to conduct regular security assessments to ensure that all security controls are working properly and that the network is properly protected.
