Embedded systems are computers that are designed to perform dedicated tasks within larger systems. They are installed into a physical system, such as a car or a washing machine, and their job is to control and monitor the functioning of that system. Embedded systems are often used in consumer electronics, such as smartphones and tablets, and in medical devices, such as pacemakers and hearing aids.

Embedded systems are programmed to perform a specific task or set of tasks. This requires the system to be able to receive, process, and send data to other systems in order to control and monitor the system that it is embedded in. The programming of an embedded system is often written in a low-level language, such as C or assembly language, in order to optimize the performance of the system.

Embedded systems can provide many advantages to users. These include improved performance, decreased power consumption, increased reliability, and improved safety. Additionally, embedded systems are often less expensive to develop and maintain than traditional systems, as they require fewer components and are more easily upgraded or replaced.

Although embedded systems can offer many benefits, they also pose some challenges. Because of their small size and specialized nature, embedded systems can be difficult to debug and troubleshoot. Additionally, they may require specialized tools and expertise to develop and maintain, which can be costly. Finally, embedded systems may be vulnerable to cyberattacks, as they can be difficult to secure.
