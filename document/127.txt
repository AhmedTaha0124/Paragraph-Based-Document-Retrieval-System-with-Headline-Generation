A data warehouse (DW or DWH) is a system used for data analysis and reporting. It is a central repository of data which is created by integrating data from various sources. Data warehouses store current and historical data which can be used for creating analytical reports for knowledge workers throughout the enterprise.

Data warehouses are made up of five components: sources, integration, storage, access, and delivery. Sources include the operational systems, external sources, and legacy systems that provide data for the warehouse. Integration is the process of combining data from multiple sources into a single, unified data structure. Storage is the database that holds the data. Access is the software that enables users to retrieve data from the warehouse and generate reports. Delivery is the mechanism used to provide users with the information they requested.

Data warehouses can provide numerous benefits to an organization. It enables businesses to make more informed decisions by providing access to a unified source of data. It allows businesses to analyze data from multiple sources and identify trends and patterns. It also helps businesses to identify potential opportunities and risks.
