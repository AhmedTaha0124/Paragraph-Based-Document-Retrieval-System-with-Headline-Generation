Data science is an interdisciplinary field of scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, structured or unstructured. It is a combination of mathematics, statistics, statistics software, domain knowledge, and machine learning, and it is used to analyze data and develop predictive models and algorithms. Data science helps organizations to make better decisions and gain insights from their data.

Data science plays a key role in helping businesses to gain insights from their data and make better decisions. By leveraging data science techniques, businesses can identify trends and patterns in their data, develop accurate models and algorithms to predict future outcomes, and create more efficient processes and systems. Data science can also help businesses gain a competitive edge by providing them with a better understanding of their customers, markets, and competitors.
