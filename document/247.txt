Embedded systems are computer systems that are designed to perform specific tasks within a larger device or system. They are designed to operate autonomously and are typically embedded within larger systems. Embedded systems are used in a variety of applications, including consumer electronics, automotive systems, medical devices, industrial automation, and aerospace systems.

Embedded systems work by performing tasks such as controlling, monitoring, and interacting with the environment. They typically feature a hardware platform (such as a microcontroller or microprocessor) and a software platform. Embedded systems are programmed to perform specific tasks, and the software can be written in a variety of languages, including C, C++, and Java.

Embedded systems offer many advantages, such as low cost, energy efficiency, and reliability. Additionally, embedded systems are versatile, and can be used in a variety of applications. For example, they can be used in medical implants, robotics, and other automated systems.

Embedded systems can be difficult to design and develop due to their complexity. Additionally, debugging and testing can be difficult due to the limited resources of embedded systems. Furthermore, embedded systems are often subject to specific security risks, which must be taken into consideration.
