Embedded systems are computer systems designed to perform a dedicated function within a larger system or machine. They are typically found in consumer, industrial and automotive applications. Embedded systems usually provide the user with feedback or control of their environment. The software and hardware components used in embedded systems are specifically designed for the application and are usually much more reliable and cost-effective than generic computer systems.

Embedded systems come in a variety of types, such as real-time embedded systems, networked embedded systems, and distributed embedded systems. Real-time embedded systems are designed to respond to external events and conditions within a specific time frame. Networked embedded systems are connected to other systems and devices to share data and resources. Distributed embedded systems are composed of multiple computers and/or devices that work together to perform a task.

Embedded systems offer a number of advantages over traditional computer systems. They are usually more reliable, cost-effective, and have a smaller form factor. Additionally, embedded systems are designed to perform specific tasks, so they are not bogged down by the need to multitask. Embedded systems also consume less power, making them ideal for battery-powered applications.

Embedded systems can be challenging to develop and maintain. The software and hardware components must be tailored to the specific application and carefully tested to ensure that they are reliable and secure. Additionally, embedded systems are often difficult to update and maintain due to their specialized nature. As such, it is important to plan for long-term support and maintenance when designing an embedded system.
