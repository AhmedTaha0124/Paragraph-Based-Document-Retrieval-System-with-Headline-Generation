Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

Machine learning algorithms are classified into two main categories: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning algorithms are used when the output is known and the goal is to create a model that can predict the output from the input data. Unsupervised learning algorithms are used when the output is unknown and the goal is to detect underlying patterns from the input data.

Machine learning is widely used in many different application areas such as healthcare, finance, education, transportation, and manufacturing. In healthcare, machine learning is used to diagnose diseases, predict patient outcomes, and recommend treatments. In finance, machine learning is used to predict stock prices, detect fraud, and automate financial trading. In education, machine learning is used to personalize learning experiences and recommend learning paths. In transportation, machine learning is used to predict traffic patterns, optimize routes, and predict maintenance needs.

The main benefit of machine learning is its ability to automate decisions and processes, which can result in increased efficiency and accuracy. Machine learning also allows for more personalized experiences by providing tailored recommendations and services based on user data. Additionally, machine learning can detect patterns and anomalies in data that may not be obvious to humans, which can lead to new insights and discoveries.
