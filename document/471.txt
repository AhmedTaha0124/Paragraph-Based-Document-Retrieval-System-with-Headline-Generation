A firewall is a set of related programs, located at a network gateway server, which protects the resources of a private network from users from other networks. Firewalls can be implemented in both hardware and software, or a combination of both. Firewalls are frequently used to prevent unauthorized Internet users from accessing private networks connected to the Internet, especially intranets. All messages entering or leaving the intranet pass through the firewall, which examines each message and blocks those that do not meet the specified security criteria.

Network segmentation is the practice of dividing a larger network into smaller sub-networks or segments. This is an effective way to contain the spread of malware and improve the overall security of the network. Network segmentation can also help to reduce the risk of data breaches by isolating sensitive data on a separate network segment. By segmenting the network, organizations can ensure that any malicious traffic is restricted to the affected sub-network rather than propagating to other parts of the network.

Access control is a set of rules and regulations that define who can access a system or network and what they can do with it. Access control helps to ensure that only authorized users are allowed to access the system or network and that they can only perform the actions that are explicitly granted to them. Access control also helps to protect against malicious attacks by allowing administrators to restrict access to certain areas of the system or network.

Encryption is the practice of scrambling data in order to make it unreadable to anyone who does not have the encryption key. Encryption is used to secure sensitive data as it travels across networks, as well as to protect data stored on computers and other devices. Encryption can help to protect against unauthorized access to data and can also help to prevent data breaches by ensuring that even if the data is accessed, it will be unreadable.
