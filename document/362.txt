Cyber security is an increasingly important and relevant topic in our modern world, with our data and information increasingly online. Cyber security is the practice of protecting systems, networks and programs from digital attacks. These attacks are typically aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money from users, or interrupting normal business processes. Cyber security also includes protecting against the unauthorized use of hardware and software, as well as protecting against the exploitation of vulnerabilities in hardware and software. As businesses and individuals utilize more and more technology, cyber security has become a critical part of protecting our data and information.

Cyber security threats come in many forms, but the most common include malware, ransomware, phishing, and social engineering. Malware is malicious software used to gain access to computers and networks without authorization. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts or locks data and requires a ransom in exchange for the data to be unlocked. Phishing is an attempt to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details by disguising as a trustworthy entity. Social engineering is the practice of manipulating people into revealing confidential information or performing certain actions.

There are a number of best practices that can be implemented to protect against cyber security threats. These include using strong passwords and two-factor authentication, using an anti-virus and anti-malware software, regularly patching and updating software, and using a secure browser. Additionally, it is important to be aware of phishing emails and other social engineering attacks, and be careful when clicking on links or downloading attachments. Finally, it is important to use the principle of least privilege when granting access to information or systems.

The impact of a successful cyber security breach can be significant and far-reaching. It can result in the loss of sensitive data, financial losses due to fraud or ransomware, and reputational damage. The cost of a data breach can vary, but the average cost is estimated to be around $3.86 million. Additionally, a cyber security breach can cause disruption to normal business operations, resulting in further financial losses. As such, it is important to take measures to protect against cyber security threats and ensure that systems and networks remain secure.
