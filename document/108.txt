A data warehouse is a specialized type of database designed to store and analyze large sets of data from multiple sources. It is used to integrate data from multiple sources, such as operational systems, and allow users to quickly and easily access it for reporting and analysis. Data warehouses are typically used for creating business intelligence solutions, such as reporting and analytics, and for making data-driven decisions.
