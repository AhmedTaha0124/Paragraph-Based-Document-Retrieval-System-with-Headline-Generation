Cyber security refers to the protection of internet-connected systems, including hardware, software and data, from cyber-attacks. Cyber security measures are designed to detect and defend against malicious activity targeting computer networks and data. These measures can include software programs, firewalls, intrusion prevention systems and data encryption. Cyber security is becoming increasingly important as more businesses and individuals rely on computers and the internet to store and transmit sensitive information.

Cyber security can be improved by staying up to date with the latest security updates, avoiding unsafe websites, and utilizing strong passwords and two-factor authentication. Businesses can also invest in cyber security tools such as firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems. Additionally, it is important to train employees on security best practices and create and enforce policies that ensure the security of sensitive data.

Phishing is a type of cyber attack where an attacker attempts to obtain sensitive information such as passwords or financial information by sending emails or messages that appear to be from a legitimate source. These messages often contain malicious links or attachments that can install malware or redirect users to malicious websites. It is important to be aware of phishing attacks and to never click on suspicious links or provide sensitive information.

A data breach is a security incident in which sensitive, confidential, or personal information is accessed or stolen by an unauthorized party. Data breaches can happen when hackers gain access to a companyâ€™s systems or when employees unintentionally expose confidential information. It is important to take steps to protect data, such as creating strong passwords, encrypting data, and regularly backing up data.
