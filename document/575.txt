Chatbots are computer programs that interact with people using artificial intelligence (AI). They are designed to simulate conversations with humans and provide automated services, such as answering customer inquiries, providing customer support, and making online purchases. They can also be used to automate repetitive tasks, such as data entry and customer service. Chatbots can provide a more personalized user experience, as they are able to understand and respond to user input in natural language.

Chatbots work by understanding the userâ€™s intent and providing an appropriate response. They use a combination of natural language processing (NLP), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) to understand the intent of the user and generate an appropriate response. Chatbots are able to learn from their conversations with users and improve their responses over time.

Language modeling is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on understanding the meaning of natural language and how it is used in communication. It is used to create computer programs that can understand language and generate responses in a more natural way. Language models use statistical analysis of large amounts of text to learn the patterns of language, and then use this knowledge to generate new text.

Legal language modeling (LLM) is a specialized branch of language modeling that focuses on understanding and generating legal documents. LLM uses AI and natural language processing (NLP) to create computer programs that can generate legal documents that are tailored to specific situations. LLM is used to automate the process of creating legal documents, which can save time and money for businesses, attorneys, and other legal professionals.
